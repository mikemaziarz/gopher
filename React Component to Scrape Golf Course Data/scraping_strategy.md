# Golf Course Data Scraping Strategy

## Findings from Newport National Golf Club

The golf course data is typically found on a dedicated "Ratings" or "Scorecard" page. The data structure includes:
- Course name: Newport National Golf Club
- Tee names: Black, Gold, White, Red (color-coded)
- Slope values: 139, 132, 127, 123
- Rating values: 74.1, 71.6, 68.3, 69.5

## Common Patterns Observed

1. **URL Patterns**: Golf courses often have dedicated pages like `/ratings/`, `/scorecard/`, `/course-info/`
2. **Data Structure**: Information is typically presented in tables or structured lists
3. **Keywords**: Look for "Slope", "Rating", "Course Rating", "Tee", color names (Black, Gold, White, Red, Blue, Yellow)
4. **HTML Structure**: Data is often in `<table>` elements or structured `<div>` containers

## Scraping Strategy

1. **Multi-step approach**:
   - First, search for common page patterns
   - Look for keywords like "slope", "rating", "scorecard"
   - Extract structured data from tables or lists

2. **Fallback mechanisms**:
   - If dedicated pages aren't found, search the main site
   - Use text pattern matching for slope/rating data
   - Handle different HTML structures

3. **Data extraction**:
   - Parse HTML tables for structured data
   - Use regex patterns for unstructured text
   - Normalize tee names and numerical values

## Implementation Plan

- Create a Python backend service for web scraping
- Use libraries like BeautifulSoup, requests, and selenium if needed
- Implement error handling and fallback strategies
- Return standardized JSON format for React component consumption
