# Gopher 🏌️‍♂️

**Gopher** is a personal web app project to track golf rounds, calculate a USGA-compliant handicap index, and store round memories (like photos!). It’s being built as a learning journey by a first-time developer — a *citizen coder* — using ChatGPT as an AI co-developer.

## 🔭 Purpose

This project serves two goals:
1. Build a fully functional golf handicap tracker with multi-user support.
2. Demonstrate what's possible when non-engineers build apps with AI-powered help.

## 🌟 Features (MVP)

- Track past and future golf rounds
- Edit round history
- Upload photos or files for each round
- View your handicap index on a dashboard
- Filter, sort, and view round stats
- Role-based access:
  - **Players** see their data
  - **Admins** can view all players

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React + Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL, Auth, File Storage)
- **Hosting**: Vercel or Netlify (TBD)
- **Dev Tools**: GitHub, ChatGPT (4o)

## 📖 Project Journal

This is part of a public learning series to document the journey of building a web app from scratch with ChatGPT.
